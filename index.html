              My name is Alexis San Javier. I was born in Mexico but I have
              lived in the USA, and specifically Florida, for most of my life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I grew up in Lakeland and after graduating from High School, I
              went on to attend the University of Central Florida. In 2017 I
              graduated with my BS in computer engineering, and after
              graduation, I worked as a research technician, and as an
              instructor at an after school academy teaching children how to
              program micro-controllers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As of recent I took a hiatus and have been contemplating my next
              career move. I have been experimenting with web apps and as a
              result, my interest in this area has grown. So to solidify and
              expand my skill in this area I have enrolled in a full-stack
              Bootcamp at The University of Central Florida. With this
              experience, I hope to start a new chapter in my career.
